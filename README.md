# Bungalow-RC-Project-2021
Passion project by engineering & design students to create a RC car and controller from scratch 
## The Team
- Mechanical Engineer:   [Samuel Creati](https://github.com/orgs/BungalowCo/people/MarshallBluey3899)
- Industrial Designer:   [Daniel Nguyen](https://github.com/orgs/BungalowCo/people/Danru153)
- Mechatronics Engineer: [Henrique Pureza](https://github.com/orgs/BungalowCo/people/IkePureza)
- Operations Engineer:   [Justin Nguyen](https://github.com/orgs/BungalowCo/people/LANGA326)
- Mechanical Engineer:   [Michael Culvenor](https://github.com/orgs/BungalowCo/people/michaelculvenor)
- Operations Engineer:   [James Andreevski](https://github.com/orgs/BungalowCo/people/NotStrategic)
## Aim and Premise
- To design and build an electronic RC car that features **consistent** RC communication, **reliable** steering, **quick** response times, **robust** suspension and **high** acceleration/torque while offering **modularity** of the chassis and mechanical parts.
- To build a **portable** and **handheld** RC controller that is **programmable** (and thus, **universal**) which can communicate **effortlessly** to the radio tranceiver on the RC car
## Terminology
- Bottom plate – A rigid structure that sits on the floor of the car and is where most of the vehicle’s internals are attached
- Chassis – The main body of the vehicle that is attached to the bottom plate
- RC controller – The device that allows control of the RC car via radio transmission
- RC transmitter – The component inside the RC controller which emits radio signals
- RC transceiver – The electronics in the RC car that receives and processes incoming radio signals
## Structure  
Following an Agile management structure.  
Involves weekly meetings, Sprints and weekly tasks.
The team is broken down into 4 sections: Operations, M-Section, D-Section & E-Section:
> - Operations is responsible for facillitating the other sections, procurement of assets, documentation and team direction
> - M-Section is responsible for the mechanical design, testing and manufacturing aspects of the project
> - D-Section is responsible for the aesthetic and practical design
> - E-Section is responsible for the electronic design, testing and manufacturing aspects of the project
 ## Design
Top down design approach will be used on this project

## Road map
- Consists of 4 Phases:
1. Prototyping Phase
2. Finalisation Phase
3. Production Phase
4. Refinement Phase
- Currently, only the first two phases are in motion as the following stages require the completion of the first two stages.
